<h2>What is this project ?</h2>

This <b>play-pac4j-scala-demo</b> project is a Play 2.x Scala project to test the <a href="https://github.com/leleuj/play-pac4j">play-pac4j library</a> with Facebook, Twitter, form authentication, basic auth, CAS...<br />
The <b>play-pac4j</b> library is built to delegate authentication to a provider and be authenticated back in the protected application with a complete user profile retrieved from the provider.

<h2>Quick start & test</h2>

To test, you can call a protected url by clicking on the "Protected by <b>xxx</b> : <b>xxx</b>/index.html" url, which will start the authentication process with the <b>xxx</b> provider.<br />
Or you can click on the "Authenticate with <b>xxx</b>" link, to start manually the authentication process with the <b>xxx</b> provider.
